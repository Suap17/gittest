# view: +insights_data {

#     type: string
#     sql: ${TABLE}.name ;;
#   }
#   }
  # explore: +sentence_turn_number {
  #   label: "new_name"
  # }
# For example we could add a new dimension to a view:
#     view: +flights {
#       dimension: air_carrier {
#         type: string
#         sql: ${TABLE}.air_carrier ;;
#       }
#     }
#
# Or apply a label to an explore:
#     explore: +aircraft {
#       label: "Aircraft Simplified"
#     }
